Calderside Mill - details from the 1899 lease


The following information comes from a lease from Claderside company to The Calderside dyeing Company dated 19th October 1899. The lease was for 14 years at an annual rent of Â£350.


Much of the lease is about legal rights and responsibilities, but it also contains an inventory of fixtures and fitting which give an insight into the mill workings. The word wince occurs a great deal, it is possible that this refers to a winch for pulling stuff out of vats etc.
